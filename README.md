This is a script that helps to overflow some buffers while uploading a file


Sometimes application file upload feature among the files that tend to cause bufferoverflow vulnerabilites. So I wrote a script that helps to create a wished file. That programs takes payload size input and filetype input. So when we are trying to upload required file with our payload to overflow buffer, that does easier our work.
