This is a script that helps to overflow some buffers while uploading a file


Some applications' file upload features may cause buffer overflow vulnerabilities. So I wrote a small script that helps to create the wished file. That program takes payload size input and filetypes input from the user. So when we are trying to upload a file with the required extension and with our payload with the size which overflows the buffer, this program creates it for us!
